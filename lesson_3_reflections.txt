When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Lots of reasons. First of all, and perhaps most commonly, in order to be able to work from multiple locations, either yourself or as a team of developers.

Secondly, you might use github as a backup for your code, in case your lose your local storage.

Third, you might create it on github as a way to demonstrate your mad programming skills to potential employers or other developers, as a working resume.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because on a large project with many participants you would end up spending a lot of time merging and reconciling conflicts.
